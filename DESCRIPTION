Title: Permutation Enrichment Testing for Binary Data
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Piotr Tymoszuk <piotr.s.tymoszuk@gmail.com>
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: The package offers an enrichment test for differences in frequencies of 
    binary variables such as genetic alterations alterations in two or more 
    analysis groups. The test simulates expected frequencies of features of 
    interest taking into account general alteration rates in the observations. 
    As such it is expected to be immune to the IID assumption required e.g. by 
    Fisher's exact test.
